# ðŸŽ¯ streams-and-lambdas-assignment


### **Objective**
This assignment is designed to help you gain hands-on experience with the **Java Stream API**. You will write functional-style code to solve real-world data processing problems.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Instructions**
- Use **Java Streams** for all solutions unless otherwise stated.
- Do not use traditional loops (`for`, `while`, etc.) unless required.
- Create a separate Java class for each question inside the `src/` directory.

        empObj.add(e1);
        empObj.add(e2);
        empObj.add(e3);
empObj.stream()
        .filter(x-> x.salary > 50000)
        .map(x-> x.name)
        .forEach(x -> System.out.println(x));

#### **Q2. Word Frequency Counter**
Given a list of words, return a map with the frequency of each word.

```java
List<String> words = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "apple");
Map<String, Integer> MapObj = new HashMap<>();
